# Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control-in-Project-OpenCV-Python
🎵 Hand Gesture Volume Control using OpenCV & Python 🖐️
This project allows users to control system volume using hand gestures, leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python.

✨ Features
✅ Detects hand gestures in real time using MediaPipe Hands
✅ Calculates the distance between thumb and index finger to adjust volume
✅ Integrates with system volume controls using pycaw
✅ Smooth volume transitions for better user experience
✅ Works with any webcam

🔧 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

OpenCV (for image processing)

MediaPipe (for hand tracking)

pycaw (for volume control)

📌 How It Works
The webcam captures the user's hand.

MediaPipe detects hand landmarks.

The distance between the thumb and index finger is mapped to volume levels.

The system volume is adjusted accordingly.
